Complex three dimensional field maps can be efficiently de-noised and compressed in data volume by high order single value decomposition. And extension of the method to inter/extrapolation and determination of basis function representation is included.
omplex three dimensional field maps can be efficiently de-noised and compressed in data volume
by high order single value decomposition. After successful application to electric field maps of a
drift tube linac [X. Du and L. Groening, Compression and noise reduction of field maps, Phys. Rev.
Accel. Beams 21, 084601 (2018)], extension of the method to inter/extrapolation and determination
of basis function representation is reported here. Inter/extrapolation of de-noised and compressed
maps is applied to spatial coordinates and to the parameters defining the geometry of devices
creating such maps. The method significantly increases efficiency of provision of compact and noise-
free maps combined with high resolution. The method is illustrated by creating corresponding maps
for RF-cells of radio frequency quadrupoles.
